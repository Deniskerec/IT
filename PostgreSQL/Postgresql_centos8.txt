Install postgresql Centos 8

**INSTALLATION**

-> list the available PostgreSQL modules
	dnf module list postgresql
	
	sudo dnf install @postgresql:10
-> Install the contrib package which provides several additional features
for the PostgresQSL database 
	(add later, need to learn about this -> https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/contrib.html)
	sudo dnf install postgresql-contrib

-> Now you need to Inotialize the PostgreSQL database 
	sudo postgresql-setup initdb
** remember where the database is initalized. After the process is finished you get it listed in the terminal **
( * Initializing database in '/var/lib/pgsql/data'
 * Initialized, logs are in /var/lib/pgsql/initdb_postgresql.log )

->Start Postgresql service and enable it to start on boot
	sudo systemctl enable --now postgresql 

_____________________________________________________________________

**POSTGRESQL**

-> connect to the server
	sudo -u postgres psql
	(postgres=# )

* ROLES and AUTHENTICATION methods
	(PostgreSQL handles the database access permissions using the concept of roles. Roles - database user/group of database users.)

AUTH METHODS 
- Trust- A role can connect without a password as long as the conditions defined in the pg_hba.cong are met 

- Password

- Ident - only supported on TCP connections. It works by obtaining the client's operating system user name, with an optional user name mapping. 

- Peer - same as Ident , but is supported on local connection only. 

!!Postgresql client authentication is defined in the congifuration file named pg_hba.conf By defaout. tor local connections, Postgresql is set to use the perr autheitcaiton method. !!



** The postgres user is automatically created when you install the PostgreSQL server. This user is the superuser for the PostgreSQL instance. It is equivalent to the MySQL root user.**


-> To log in to the PostgreSQL server as the postgres user, first switch to the user and then access the PostgreSQL prompt using the psql utility:
	sudo su - postgres
	psql
	\ - exit psql sheel.

_______________________________________________________________________

-> Creating PostgreSQL Role and Database 

Only superusers and roles with CREATEROLE privilege can create new rols. 

-> connect to the PSQL shell adn create a new user and databse and grant all privileges on the databse
	sudo -u postgres psql
	create role denis;
	create database denisdb;
	grant all privileges on databse denisdb to denis;

_______________________________________________________________________

-> Enable rebote access to PostgresSQL server

default - 127.0.0.1

-> To enable remote acces 
	!!sudo vi /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf!!
-> CONNECTIONS AND AUTHENTICATIONS section
	listen_addresses ='*'
	sudo systemctl restart postgresql

->LAST STEP -> congfigure the server to accept remote connections by editing the pg_hba.conf gile
	** remember trust, peer and shit ..

 ** maybe you need to reboot you'r pc **
	sudo su
	cd var/lib/pgsql/data
	**for me - dnf instrall vim **
	vim pg_hba.conf

-> if you just fool around change all METHODS to trust, so you can play with it, otherwise follow this link for mor einformation
