!! grep !! 
This is one of the most useful commands for the admin. It receives a file or the output
of a command as an input and shows only those lines that contain a certain pattern. For
example, to see the contents of the /etc/passwd file with cat like -
             cat /etc/passwd 
 or we can specify exsaclty what we need with -
             cat /etc/passwd | grep root

!! more !!

If the file we try to see with the cat command is too long, we won’t be able to see all the
content in a single screen, as the text will immediately scroll down. If we want to see the
full content, we can use the more command. This way, we’ll be able to see the whole text
one screen at a time, manually passing to the next one..

!! less !!

less is pretty similar to more . We can see a long file one screen at the time, the only
difference being that less allows us to go back to a previous page. With more , once we
advance to the next page, we can’t go back (unless we exit more and execute it again).

!! head !!

We’ve seen that we can use cat to see the content of a file. Nevertheless, if the file is too
long, the content will fill many screens. We could use more or less to see one page at a
time, but maybe we just want to see the first lines. In this case, we can simply type “head
filename”, and we’ll see the first 10 lines (by default) of the file.

If we wanted to see just the first three lines, we’d use -n 3 . For example-

# head -n 3 /etc/group

!! tail !!

tail is a command similar to head , but it will show the last lines of the file instead of the
first ones. So, to see the last four lines of the file /etc/group , we can do this:

[root@localhost named]# tail -n 4 /etc/group

A really useful option of the tail command is -f . The last lines of the file will appear
on the screen, which will also show the new lines added in real time. For instance, if we
want to see what system events are taking place right now, we can open the /var/log/
messages file with the -f option. Once we’re done, we exit by pressing Ctrl+C.
