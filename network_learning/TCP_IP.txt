	Reordery -> not a correct sequence (zaporedje)
	Multiple conversations (network conversation it enga mesta več paketov)
	Flow Control 


TCP -> (protocol number for TPC is 6)
* breaks data automatically into smaller segments which of them fit into an IP package( host A send a package and host B recieve it as it was send )
* once the host B recives the packages from the host A, the host B send an acknowledgement to the host A.
* keeps track of the right sequence of the packages as it sends them  
	- Byte stream service - connection oriented ( before anything happens the host A has to establish a TCP connection with the host B - like a phone call, before you can talk to anyone you have to dial the number.
		Byte stream service meaning : 
			once the TCP connection is established eather side can send a stream of bytes .. 
		
	- reliable
