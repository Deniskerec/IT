We have to open port on the modem so from the outside network ( not local ) you can access the server. 

for example (default)

ssh      port 22
apache   port 80
psql     port 5432

I also had to add Incoming filtering (because the firewall on my modem blocks all incoming IP Traffic. Ip traffic can be accepted by setting up filters. 



ICMP -> ssh
TCP or UDP -> so some traffic ?? dont know exactly what this is but i gave it a range from 1:65535
