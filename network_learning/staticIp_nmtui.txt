static IP 

As happened in CentOS 6, the IP address we have just assigned will be temporary. If
we want to make it persistent, we’ll have to edit the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
ifcfg-enp0s3 file and add the following lines:
IPADDR=192.168.10.19
BOOTPROTO=static
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
TYPE=Ethernet
_________________________________
We’ll have to set the parameter ONBOOT=yes , so that the network interface gets
activated every time the system boots. This way, we have assigned a static IP address to
the server, but it is more convenient to use a network utility. In CentOS 6 we used system-
config-network , but this command is not available in CentOS 7. Instead, we must use
nmtui

edit -> iPv4 ( my case the ip for port forwarding was 192.168.1.15/24)

Address 192.168.1.15
Gateway 192.168.1.1

save 
restart network.
