HOW to define your script's interpreter as BASH ?

First locate a full path to its executable bunary using which command, prefix with a shebang #! and insert it as the first linf of you're script.

which bash ( get the path for bash)
 - in our case its -> /usr/bin/bash -> could be also /bin/bash
______________________________________
(we have a task.sh script created in a certain directory)

vi task.sh
- in the first line of that scipt add #!/usr/bin/bash
save the script when edited and run it.
