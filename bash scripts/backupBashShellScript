any command whuich can be successfully executed directly via bash shell terminal can be in the same form used as part of bash shell script. In fact there is no difference between command executuon directly via terminal or whithin a sheell script apart from the fact from the fast that the shell script offers non-interactive execution of multiple commands as a single process. 

Additionally, most commands accept so called 'options' as arguments. Commands options are used to modify command's behavior to produce alternatiove output results and are frefixed by -. 

In this example we create a preactical application as it can be used to bacup our user home directory /home/linuxconfig.

backup.sh
#!/bin/bash

tar -czf /tmp/myhome_directory.tar.gz /home/linuxconfig


chmod +x backup.sh

./backup.sh
